### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vibe-coding-kit.git
   cd vibe-coding-kit
   ```

2. **Run the setup script:**

   - Go to Preferences ‚Üí Profiles
   - Click the down arrow ‚Üí Import
   - Select `Vibe-Coding-Kit.streamDeckProfile` from this repo
   - The profile will automatically map all 6 buttons

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up buttons manually:

1. Open Stream Deck software
2. Drag a "System: Open" action to each button
3. For each button, set:
   - **App/File:** Navigate to the corresponding script in `scripts/` folder
   - **Icon:** Use the matching icon from `icons/` folder

## üé® Customization

### Modifying Scripts

All scripts are in the `scripts/` directory. Feel free to modify them for your needs:

```bash
# Example: Change ChatGPT to Claude
vim scripts/open-chatgpt.sh
# Change the URL to https://claude.ai
```

### Regenerating Icons

Icons are auto-generated with text labels. To customize:

1. Edit `setup.sh` and modify the `generate_icon` calls
2. Run `./setup.sh` again to regenerate
3. Or replace with your own 512x512 PNG images in `icons/`

### Adding New Buttons

1. Create a new script in `scripts/`:
   ```bash
   cp scripts/open-chatgpt.sh scripts/open-myapp.sh
   vim scripts/open-myapp.sh
   ```

2. Generate an icon:
   ```bash
   ./tools/generate-icon.sh "M" "myapp.png" "#color"
   ```

3. Map it in Stream Deck software

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Scripts not executing on Stream Deck

1. Ensure scripts have execute permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. Check Stream Deck has necessary permissions (macOS):
   - System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Accessibility
   - Add Stream Deck

### Icons not showing

- Ensure icons are 512x512 PNG format
- Check `icons/` directory has the generated files
- Try reimporting the profile

### Windows Support

For Windows users:
1. Install [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
2. Run scripts through WSL:
   ```bash
   wsl ./scripts/open-chatgpt.sh
   ```
3. Or use the included `windows/` batch file wrappers (coming soon)
